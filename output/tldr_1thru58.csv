". While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place , devoted altogether to saving the Union without war , insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war-seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation . Both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God 's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men 's faces , but let us judge not , that we be not judged ; for it must needs be that offenses come , but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\ "" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which , in the providence of God , must needs come , but which , having continued through His appointed time , He now wills to remove , and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came , shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him . Yet , if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said \""the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\""With malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations","While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war-seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation.

". With foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms , and in the adjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belonging to a gallant people . With regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view to revenue , it would seem to me that the spirit of equity , caution , and compromise in which the Constitution was formed requires that the great interests of agriculture , commerce , and manufactures should be equally favored , and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may be found essential to our national independence . The recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of Executive duties , in characters too legible to be overlooked , the task of ' reform ' , which will require particularly the correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage of the Federal Government into conflict with the freedom of elections , and the counteraction of those causes which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have placed or continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands . In the performance of a task thus generally delineated I shall endeavor to select men whose diligence and talents will insure in their respective stations able and faithful cooperation , depending for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the public officers than on their numbers . And a firm reliance on the goodness of that Power whose providence mercifully protected our national infancy , and has since upheld our liberties in various vicissitudes , encourages me to offer up my ardent supplications that He will continue to make our beloved country the object of His divine care and gracious benediction","With foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms, and in the adjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belonging to a gallant people.

". To this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted , and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several States and of the United States which the people themselves have ordained for their own government .

But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future .

": There is no constitutional or legal requirement that the President shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people , but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the Government the people , to whose service the official oath consecrates the officer , have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial . Our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which accompanied the institution of government under the Constitution , or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of Washington and his great associates , and hope and courage in the contrast which thirty-eight populous and prosperous States offer to the thirteen States , weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty , that then fringed our Atlantic seaboard ? I do not doubt that if those men in the South who now accept the tariff views of Clay and the constitutional expositions of Webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions they would not find it difficult , by friendly instruction and cooperation , to make the black man their efficient and safe ally , not only in establishing correct principles in our national administration , but in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social order and economical and honest government . The duty devolved by law upon the President to nominate and , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to appoint all public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the Constitution or by act of Congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty .

". Where great principles are involved , where great movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movements their actual support , we ought not to withhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential difference , but only upon the ground of the most important and compelling fundamental reasons .

". Abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us , we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace .

". Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit . It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself , treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war , but at the same time , through this employment , accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources . Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and , by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution , endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land ; that if we are to go forward , we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline , because without such discipline no progress is made , no leadership becomes effective .

". We of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable , to solve problems once considered unsolvable . They hold out the clear hope that government within communities , government within the separate States , and government of the United States can do the things the times require , without yielding its democracy . The essential democracy of our Nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power , but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections . I see a United States which can demonstrate that , under democratic methods of government , national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown , and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence .

". I intend that my Administration shall leave no blot upon our fair record , and trust I may safely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my constitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of our citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the tribunal of the civilized world . So long as he can discern every star in its place upon that ensign , without wealth to purchase for him preferment or title to secure for him place , it will be his privilege , and must be his acknowledged right , to stand unabashed even in the presence of princes , with a proud consciousness that he is himself one of a nation of sovereigns and that he can not in legitimate pursuit wander so far from home that the agent whom he shall leave behind in the place which I now occupy will not see that no rude hand of power or tyrannical passion is laid upon him with impunity . But these , like many other subjects , will be appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the coordinate branches of the Government , to which I shall always look with profound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord to me the aid and support which I shall so much need and which their experience and wisdom will readily suggest . The great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the State and Federal authorities , and experience has shown that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just discrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the States and your common rights and obligations under the General Government . In expressing briefly my views upon an important subject rich has recently agitated the nation to almost a fearful degree , I am moved by no other impulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that Union which has made us what we are , showering upon us blessings and conferring a power and influence which our fathers could hardly have anticipated , even with their most sanguine hopes directed to a far-off future","I intend that my Administration shall leave no blot upon our fair record, and trust I may safely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my constitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of our citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the tribunal of the civilized world.

But these, like many other subjects, will be appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the coordinate branches of the Government, to which I shall always look with profound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord to me the aid and support which I shall so much need and which their experience and wisdom will readily suggest. The great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the State and Federal authorities, and experience has shown that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just discrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the States and your common rights and obligations under the General Government.

Perceiving no valid objection to the measure and many reasons for its adoption vitally affecting the peace, the safety, and the prosperity of both countries, I shall on the broad principle which formed the basis and produced the adoption of our Constitution, and not in any narrow spirit of sectional policy, endeavor by all constitutional, honorable, and appropriate means to consummate the expressed will of the people and Government of the United States by the reannexation of Texas to our Union at the earliest practicable period."

Proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture , in the successful enterprises of commerce , in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts , in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt , and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land . Indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations , it has been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by observing justice , and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality ; to carry on the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state--as far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the fulfillment of my duty , they will be a resource which can not fail me . I may , however , be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my heart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved country , gratefully bestowed or exalted talents zealously devoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness . In these my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed , next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations , whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic , and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past , as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future","Proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture, in the successful enterprises of commerce, in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts, in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt, and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land.

".

And let us be proud that by our bold, new initiatives, by our steadfastness for peace with honor, we have made a breakthrough toward creating in the world what the world has not known before--a structure of peace that can last, not merely for our time, but for generations to come. Let us pledge together to make these next 4 years the best 4 years in America 's history, so that on its 200th birthday America will be as young and as vital as when it began, and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world. Let us go forward from here confident in hope, strong in our faith in one another, sustained by our faith in God who created us, and striving always to serve His purpose."

When our Founders boldly declared America 's independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change.
